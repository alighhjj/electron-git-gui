# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Enhance an Electron-based Git GUI application with SSH configuration functionality, improve UI design of SSH configuration pages, and resolve SSH host verification issues to enable secure Git operations via SSH protocol.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Electron, React, simple-git library, webpack
- **Build Commands**: `npm run build-renderer`, `npm start`
- **Architecture**: Main process handles Git operations via simple-git, renderer process provides React UI
- **SSH Configuration**: Added SSH key generation, known_hosts management, and remote URL conversion capabilities
- **Security**: Supports both HTTPS and SSH protocols for Git operations with proper host verification
- **Error Handling**: Implements fallback mechanisms for SSH host verification with predefined keys for GitHub/GitLab

## Recent Actions
### SSH Configuration Implementation
1. **[DONE]** Added SSH configuration button to Project Panel
2. **[DONE]** Created SSHConfigModal component with comprehensive SSH key management
3. **[DONE]** Implemented SSH key generation functionality in main process
4. **[DONE]** Added remote URL conversion from HTTPS to SSH format

### UI Design Improvements
1. **[DONE]** Optimized SSH configuration page with proper list indentation and font sizes
2. **[DONE]** Improved layout with better spacing, margins, and typography
3. **[DONE]** Added "Check GitHub Host Verification" button to SSH config page

### SSH Host Verification Resolution
1. **[DONE]** Added SSH known_hosts management functions in main process
2. **[DONE]** Implemented multiple fallback methods for SSH keyscan including predefined keys for GitHub/GitLab
3. **[DONE]** Added Windows compatibility for SSH operations with proper path handling
4. **[DONE]** Fixed known_hosts verification to accurately report success/failure

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **[DONE]** Fixed variable redeclaration bug in main.js
2. **[DONE]** Added proper error handling for SSH algorithm incompatibilities
3. **[DONE]** Enhanced error messages with more user-friendly information

## Current Plan
### Completed Features
- [DONE] SSH configuration button in Project Panel
- [DONE] SSH key generation and configuration functionality
- [DONE] Remote URL conversion from HTTPS to SSH format
- [DONE] Improved SSH configuration UI with proper spacing and typography
- [DONE] SSH host verification with multiple fallback methods
- [DONE] Windows compatibility for SSH operations
- [DONE] Predefined host keys for GitHub and GitLab
- [DONE] Accurate success/failure reporting for SSH operations

### Current Status
The application now successfully provides comprehensive SSH configuration capabilities. Users can generate SSH keys, convert remote URLs from HTTPS to SSH format, add host keys to known_hosts, and resolve common SSH verification issues. The UI has been optimized for better readability and usability, with proper list indentation and text sizing.
