# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Develop an Electron-based Git GUI application that provides an intuitive user interface for managing Git repositories with GitHub integration, including repository initialization, file changes tracking, commit/push/pull operations, and SSH configuration.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Electron, React 18, Node.js, simple-git, Webpack
- **Project Structure**: Main process in `main/`, React components in `renderer/src/components/`, utilities in `renderer/utils/`
- **Build Commands**: `npm run build-renderer`, `npm start`, `npm run dist`
- **Key Features**: Repository management, file status tracking, Git operations (commit/push/pull), GitHub integration, branch management
- **Configuration**: Uses `electron-is-dev` for development mode detection, context isolation enabled
- **Event System**: Custom events (`remote-url-updated`, `git-commit-completed`) for component communication
- **File Structure**: Uses assets folder for icons (`assets/icon.ico`)

## Recent Actions
### UI Fixes
- [DONE] Fixed repository URL not updating when SSH/HTTPS protocol toggled in GitHub panel - implemented custom event system to sync remote URL changes between components
- [DONE] Improved push button styling to differentiate from commit button - made push button green when unpushed commits exist, gray otherwise
- [DONE] Added "Clear List" button to welcome page for clearing recent repositories
- [DONE] Fixed "Initialize Project" button not working - implemented missing `openFolderDialog` IPC handler in main process

### Functionality Improvements
- [DONE] Fixed initial push issue - completely restructured `fetchRepoInfo` logic to properly detect unpushed commits for first-time pushes
- [DONE] Enhanced error handling for repositories without commits or remote configurations
- [DONE] Fixed GitHub panel event triggering - added proper `remote-url-updated` events when adding/changing remote URLs

### Build and Distribution
- [DONE] Added GitHub Actions workflow for Windows build automation
- [DONE] Fixed application icon configuration - corrected to reference `icon.ico` for Windows
- [DONE] Fixed package.json build configuration - removed invalid `iconSize` property causing build failures
- [DONE] Corrected file paths in main process to reference proper icon file format

### Bug Fixes
- [DONE] Fixed "ambiguous argument 'origin/main..HEAD'" error for new repositories - improved rev-list command fallback logic
- [DONE] Fixed push button remaining gray even after commits - restructured commit/unpushed detection logic
- [DONE] Removed unnecessary status badges from welcome page

## Current Plan
- [DONE] All identified issues have been resolved
- [TODO] Consider adding additional Git operations (merge, rebase, tag management)
- [TODO] Enhance error handling and user feedback for more complex Git operations
- [TODO] Add support for additional Git hosting platforms (GitLab, Bitbucket)
- [TODO] Optimize performance for large repositories
